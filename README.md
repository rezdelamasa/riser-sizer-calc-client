# riser-size-calc

## Description

A WIP app for calculating water service plumbing sizes for riser diagrams. 

### How to use it

Navigate to Calculator page. You'll see an empty table with a Source row. You'll also see a form for some initialization options like Initial Hot Load Value and Initial Cold Load Value. These fields are useful for setting initial load values. (Examples below)

__Examples:__

1. The branch currently being calculated is in the middle of a riser.
2. The branch currently being calculated in a sub-branch of another branch.

Once the branch has been initialized, you can begin to add fixtures to the branch. Click the __Add Fixture__ button and a sidebar will appear on the right. Here you can find a list of all the fixtures and a search bar for filtering. On this sidebar, you can also mark a fixture as a __Favorite__ if you need to use it often. There is another category called __Recents__ which will contain a list of the last 10 fixtures added. (Useful for quickly adding more of the same fixtures from within the branch but not used enough to warrant a favorite.)

# Setup

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
